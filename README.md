# Hello!

### My name is Artemis! I'm not entirely new to coding, but I'm here to advance my knowledge.

My prior coding experience was all from [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)

My goals with Github are:

- [ ] Learn how to navigate Github
- [ ] Create a useful project
- [ ] Be able to use my codes in everyday life

Thanks for reading this!
